This helps us to know the best location to set up new restarauts .
Places like BTM , jayanagar , HSR etc have already large no of resturants in that area and
hence setting up in places like ST.mark road , ejipura etc would be beneficial

illustrates the count of resturants that support online ordering facility
across the city.

This shows the avarge rating , highest and lowest rating of diffrent resturants in a boxplot.
Green one shows the resturants providing online orders . the highest rating is around 4.8 while the lowest is around 2.9.
Yellow one shows the resturants not providing online orders . the highest rating is around 4.3 while the lowest is around 3.1

formed a pivot table which shows that in a particular location how many resturantsprovide online order vs no online orders
and then plotted in a graphical form


Hence we can conclude 
1. no of online order is more
2. Rating of resturants with online facility is more in comparison to other.
3. Areas lke BTM ,HSR have high no of resturants.
